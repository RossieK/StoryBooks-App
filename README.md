# StoryBooks-App
Application based on Node.js, Express, Handlebars, MongoDB, Passport with Google OAuth

What you need to add to the config.env is:
- PORT -> the port your web server will be running on; 
- MONGO_URI -> your mongoDB URI

Once you install all the dependancies, you can use 'npm start' in order to run the app in a production mode and 'npm run dev' in order to run it in development mode.
